# Pixel-IRC
My first public C# project. Idea is to be a minimalist full-fledged IRC client.

I am an avid IRC user and I have tried a multitude of clients. However, I'm disatisfied with the quality of the clients I have used (aside form mIRC, but for other reasons). I want something that will work as a full-fledged IRC client, but works out of the way and is there when I need it.

My idea is something accessible from the taskbar, but works like sidebar programs and doesn't make an appearance unless you want it to. Something visually minimal, but beautiful (ala Rainmeter?). So, here is my start. Keep watching as I fumble along!

# Version Updates

Branch: Version 0.0.1 - (Code Repository)

This is NOT a usable program. This branch is simply a current code dump of the most recent development phase to keep from losing critical coding data. Usable code will not be available until the first Minor release. Please stay tuned as more progress is made!
