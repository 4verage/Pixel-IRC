# Pixel-IRC
My first public C# project. Idea is to be a minimalist full-fledged IRC client.

I am an avid IRC user and I have tried a multitude of clients. However, I'm disatisfied with the quality of the clients I have used (aside form mIRC, but for other reasons). I want something that will work as a full-fledged IRC client, but works out of the way and is there when I need it.

My idea is something accessible from the taskbar, but works like sidebar programs and doesn't make an appearance unless you want it to. Something visually minimal, but beautiful (ala Rainmeter?). So, here is my start. Keep watching as I fumble along!
